Final project for CIT-65

Your final program may be an extension of your midterm app, an app from chapters 12, 13 , or 14 or
an app that you have wanted to develop all semester, but needed an excuse to do it. I will be
looking for use of  ArrayList, Fragments, Multiple Activities, and Data persistence, but do not
let these requirements restrict your app. This general task list should give you lots of room for
creative programming. A good guideline for your final program is the Chapter 10 address book.
Understand the concepts here and customize the app to your interests and you will have a
good final program.

This assignment may be done individually or in student teams. If working in teams, please submit
duplicate assignments and indidate that you are submitting a team project. In other words, every
student will have a submission even though that submission is the same as another student's. For
example, if students a, b, and c are working as a team, their assignment submission will be the same.

You may use the comments section to desctribe your program and this will count as your
"programming partner" presentation.

Submit your emulator screen shot and Java source code to this assignment as you have been doing
for your previous assignments.

Due Date: Sunday May 25 (11:59 PM)
